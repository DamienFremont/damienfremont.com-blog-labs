What tools and techniques do you use to record and share your work? Along with any tips, tutorials, costs, downloads, or social media concerns you might deal with? (Using only free tools)

When developing video games or any visual application, we often find ourselves needing skills or tools that we didn’t first consider. And because it can be so easy to get wrapped up in what WE can see (our code, our assets, our game design), we’ll often ignore what others can see, (footage, screen captures, gifs). Which can be quite harmful if you’re trying to drum up support for your latest project. Because saying that you’re working on a game is good, but showing that you are is always better.
